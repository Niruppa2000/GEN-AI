We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Recent reasoning LLMs (Li et al., 2025b) such as DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-\\nAI et al., 2025) have significantly improved mathematical problem-solving through their\\nreasoning tokens encompassing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT). These models continuously\\nscrutinize their own computational processes, boosting their self-correction capability (Ku-\\nmar et al., 2024; Song et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024; YAO et al., 2024), which enhances accuracy\\nand reliability in the reasoning. This inspires us to explore the effects of incorporating minor\\nerrors into reasoning traces and evaluating how well the models can self-correct. Therefore,\\na critical question emerges: how vulnerable are these advanced reasoning LLMs to subtle\\nerrors in their input reasoning chains?\\nWe investigate this problem by examining how reasoning LLMs respond when presented\\nwith reasoning tokens containing tampered calculation results. Our findings reveal a\\nconcerning vulnerability we term \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT): when provided with\\nreasoning tokens incorporating manipulated calculation results at the ends of reasoning\\nlogic steps, models tend to undergo thinking confusion, ignore the correct reasoning steps\\nand adopt the incorrect results instead. Even when models initially demonstrate strong\\ninclination toward the correct answer during their reasoning process, the final result may\\n∗Work done during internship at UC Merced NLP Lab.\\n†Corresponding author.\\n1\\narXiv:2503.19326v2  [cs.AI]  1 Apr 2025\\nPreprint.

When the same model is presented with\\nthe same problem but with subtly tampered reasoning tokens (changing just one digit in\\nthe final product) as its previous thinking, it produces a new reasoning chain with illogical\\ncalculation steps. In addition, the final result content includes the correct steps and incorrect\\nproduct. This inconsistency demonstrates how endpoint tampering of input reasoning\\nchain can override the model’s own reasoning capabilities. This vulnerability has important\\nimplications for the reliability of reasoning LLMs. The self-correction of LLMs is crucial for\\nenhancing their reasoning robustness. However, our work shows that current reasoning\\nLLMs, despite their advances, remain susceptible to being misled by tampered tokens,\\ncompromising their self-correction abilities.\\nTo systematically study this phenomenon, we design three increasingly explicit prompting\\nmethods to encourage models to scrutinize the tampered reasoning tokens. Our experiments\\nacross multiple reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o1(Jaech et al., 2024), o3-mini1,\\nand others) reveal that these models have difficulties in identifying wrong answers in the\\nreasoning tokens, and struggle significantly to resist CPT.\\nOur investigation into CPT reveals an interesting contrast with recent work (Li et al., 2025a)\\non reasoning chains. While existing research suggests global structural alterations to long\\nCoT more significantly impact model performance than local content modifications, we find\\nthat in reasoning vulnerabilities, endpoint token manipulations can have greater effects than\\nstructural changes. Some structural modifications even enhance CPT resistance. Addition-\\nally, we discovered that when presented with tampered reasoning tokens for mathematical\\nword problems, DeepSeek-R1 may experience \"thinking stopped\"—completely ceasing its\\nreasoning process without producing a final answer. This is a security vulnerability in\\nmodel reasoning that deserves attention.\\nAbove all, the contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) We focus on mathematical\\nproblem-solving and introduce a new research question: how well can reasoning LLMs\\nperform even in the presence of minor errors introduced in the input reasoning tokens? (2)\\nWe define the new concept of CPT and demonstrate, based on three approaches, that existing\\nreasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT; (3) We find that local ending token modifications\\nhave a greater impact on model reasoning than structural changes, which is contrary to\\nthe existing research; (4) Based on our tampered reasoning tokens, we find a security\\nvulnerability that DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to produce the final result.\\n1https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini\\n2\\nPreprint.

(2025b) discusses the evolution of different reasoning\\nLLMs and provides the comprehensive performance comparison of typical reasoning LLMs.\\n(Chen et al., 2025b) provides a summary of Long CoT, highlighting its main features, includ-\\ning deep reasoning, feasible reflection, and extensive exploration.\\nResistance of LLMs to Errors in Reasoning It is crucial to study the impact of introducing\\nminor mistakes in the reasoning process and analyze the effectiveness of the self-correction\\nof models. Mukherjee et al. (2025) focuses on improving the error identification ability of\\nLLMs in the reasoning chain. Li et al. (2025a) indicates that the structure of the long CoT is\\nvital for LLMs to learning, while small tampering to local content (for instance, the accuracy\\nof the final answer and the numerical values) do not substantially affect model performance.\\nHowever, our work reaches an opposing conclusion to some extent. In addition, many\\nstudies focus on the mathematical reasoning ability evaluation (Yuan et al., 2023; Liu et al.,\\n2024; Li et al., 2024) of LLMs. He et al. (2025) systematically studies the ability of LLMs to\\ndetect errors in long CoT reasoning, and finds that there will be calculation error, reasoning\\nerror and understanding errors in the inference of mathematical problems. But there is\\nstill relatively little research on evaluation and improvement of the model’s capability to\\nreflect and self-correct mistakes in the reasoning process (Chen et al., 2025a). Moreover, the\\nreasoning tokens may not only contain errors, but may also be inconsistent with the final\\nresults given by the reasoning LLMs (Zhou et al., 2025).\\n3\\nMethodology\\nWhen reasoning LLMs solve mathematical problems, they generate detailed reasoning\\nsteps leading to a final answer. We propose \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) to describe a\\nvulnerability where models adopt incorrect results from tampered reasoning tokens despite\\ntheir ability to calculate correctly. This behavior raises important questions about how these\\nmodels integrate prior information with current reasoning processes.\\nTo systematically investigate CPT, we first analyze the structure of reasoning tokens in\\nmathematical problem-solving (Section 3.1), then formalize the concept of CPT and develop\\nmetrics to quantify its impact (Section 3.2). We explain our approach to tampering with\\nreasoning tokens (Section 3.3), evaluate methods to enhance model resistance (Section 3.4),\\nand investigate how structural modifications affect CPT (Section 3.5).\\n3.1\\nInitial Observations on Reasoning Token Vulnerabilities\\nWhen evaluating reasoning LLMs on mathematical problems, we discovered that models\\npresented with reasoning chains containing subtle calculation errors often adopt these\\nincorrect results in their outputs, despite their ability to calculate correctly. For example,\\nwhen DeepSeek-R1 correctly solved 38,697,082 × 4,133,991, changing just one digit in\\nthe result tokens (from 159,973,388,714,262 to 159,973,389,714,262) caused it to adopt this\\nincorrect value in subsequent reasoning.\\nThis behavior appeared across multiple models, particularly when modifications targeted\\n\"loop ending result\" tokens - the numerical conclusions at critical points in reasoning. This\\nobservation raised a key question: How do reasoning LLMs prioritize between their own\\ncalculation abilities and presented calculation results? This apparent vulnerability forms the\\nbasis of our \"Compromising Thought\" (CPT) concept formalized in the following section.\\n3.2\\nCPT of Reasoning LLMs\\nWe formalize CPT as follows: Given a mathematical problem q0, we first establish that a\\nreasoning LLM can correctly solve it, generating accurate reasoning tokens rt0 and final\\nanswer s0. We then create tampered tokens rtT by modifying specific calculation results in\\nthe ending tokens of rt0 while preserving the reasoning steps. When these tampered tokens\\n3\\nPreprint. Under review.\\nare presented alongside the original problem to the models in LM, we observe whether\\nthe model’s new reasoning tokens rtc and answer sc align with the correct answer w or are\\ninfluenced by the tampered information (Algorithm 1). It should be noted that we require\\nthe initial reasoning tokens rtm and final result sm to be correct, meaning that the evaluated\\nmodel itself has the ability to correctly solve q0. Otherwise, it is unreasonable to investigate\\nwhether it is affected by CPT.\\nTo quantify CPT susceptibility, we define the compromising rate:\\nrCPT =\\nDT\\n2DT −DCPT\\n∈[0.5, 1],\\n(1)\\nwhere DT is the number of tampered digits and DCPT is the number of digits in the model’s\\noutput matching our tampered digits rather than the correct result. For instance, with a\\nsingle-digit modification (DT = 1), a value of rCPT = 1 indicates complete compromise,\\nwhile rCPT = 0.5 shows complete resistance. Specifically, when CPT causes severe reasoning\\nconfusion in models, i.e. DT < DCPT (see the instance 5 and 6 in Appendix A), rCPT = 2.\\nThe aggregate compromising rate RCPT across n evaluation results is calculated as:\\nRCPT = 1\\nn\\nn\\n∑\\ni=1\\nrCPT,i\\n(2)\\n3.3\\nTampering with Reasoning Tokens\\nAlgorithm 1: CPT Research\\nInput: Reasoning LLM set LM, question\\nq0, method Tamper for tampering with\\nending tokens, correct answer w to q0.\\nOutput: Result s.\\ns := ∅\\n(rt0, s0) ←M(q0)\\n▷M ∈LM.\\nrtT ←Tamper(rt0)\\nqT ←q0∥rtT\\nfor j = 0 to length(LM) −1 do\\n(rtm, sm) ←LMj(q0)\\nif w ⊆sm then\\n(rtc, sc) ←LMj(qT)\\nif sc ==⊥then\\nr ←⊥\\n▷Thinking stopped.\\ncontinue\\nelse\\nr ←Compare(rtm, rtc, sm, sc)\\nend\\nelse\\nr ←⊥\\ncontinue\\nend\\ns ←s ∪r\\nend\\nreturn s\\nTo systematically study CPT, we need a principled\\napproach to create tampered reasoning tokens. As\\nillustrated in Figure 2, reasoning tokens typically\\ncontain calculation loops, self-reflection, and self-\\nverification components. Our tampering strategy\\nspecifically targets the \"loop ending result\" tokens\\n- the numerical conclusions at critical points in the\\nreasoning process.\\nWe implement digit substitution as our primary\\nmethod,\\ncarefully modifying specific digits in\\ncalculation results while maintaining the origi-\\nnal format and length.\\nFor example, changing\\n\"711,025,910,075,981\" to \"711,025,710,075,981\" by re-\\nplacing ’9’ with ’7’. The instances are shown in Ap-\\npendix C. This method creates subtle numerical dis-\\ncrepancies that challenge the model’s ability to recon-\\ncile its own calculations with presented information.\\nAfter evaluating alternative approaches, we found\\nthat digit substitution is optimal for studying CPT,\\nas methods that alter result length (insertion or dele-\\ntion) tend to trigger format validation mechanisms\\nrather than testing numerical reasoning fidelity. By\\npreserving the structure and only modifying specific\\nresult digits, we can directly assess how reasoning\\nLLMs prioritize between their own calculations and\\nexternally provided conclusions.\\n3.4\\nProbing LLM Resistance to CPT\\nTo evaluate how effectively reasoning LLMs can resist CPT, we developed three increasingly\\ndirect interventions (Figure 3):\\n• Method 1 (Uncertainty Prompting): Uses filter text suggesting possible errors in the\\nreasoning tokens.\\n4\\nPreprint.

Since reasoning tokens are often not directly accessible in API-based interactions, we\\nfocus our analysis on final outputs for this condition. These interventions create a systematic\\nframework for measuring CPT resistance across models and mathematical problem types.\\nComplete examples of model responses across these conditions are provided in Appendix B.\\nMy previous thinking is incorrect, especially the final result. \\nTherefore, I should ignore my previous reasoning and rethink.\\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\"deepseek-reasoner\",\\n  messages=[\\n  {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"<Question>+<Input Suffix>\"},\\n  {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\":\"<Output Prefix>\", \"prefix\": True}])\\nprint(\"result: \", response.choices[0].message.content)\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nInput\\nSuffix\\nMethod 2\\nCode\\nOutput \\nPrefix\\nMethod 1: Uncertainty Prompting\\nMethod 2: Direct Contradiction\\nMethod 3: Output Prefix Control\\nBelow is your previous thought.

We consider self-reflection and self-verification\\ncomponents (Figure 2) as integral reasoning units. For deleted reasoning steps, we imple-\\nment two approaches: Delete-R (removing only self-reflection) and Delete-V (removing only\\nself-verification). For inserted reasoning steps, we introduce extraneous reasoning tokens\\nrelated to angle calculation between the self-reflection and self-verification components.\\nIf structural modifications have a more significant impact than content modifications on\\nreasoning outcomes, we would expect the model’s ability to resist CPT to be substantially\\nweakened when the structure is altered, leading to increased compromising thinking proba-\\nbility. Conversely, if local content modifications prove more influential, structural changes\\nmight have minimal effect or even potentially enhance CPT resistance. Through these struc-\\ntural modifications, we aim to test whether the conclusions from prior work on reasoning\\nchain structure extend to the CPT phenomenon, or whether result token modifications\\nrepresent a distinct vulnerability that operates through different mechanisms.\\n2https://api-docs.deepseek.com\\n5\\nPreprint.

Our research requires an in-depth analysis of the reasoning tokens generated\\nby reasoning LLMs. Since most model APIs do not allow direct access to these tokens,\\nautomated evaluation is difficult and extensive human assessment is required. As a result,\\nour experimental dataset is relatively concise and precise. For standalone arithmetic tasks\\n(Shrestha et al., 2025), we focus on addition and multiplication problems and construct a\\ntest dataset containing 15-digit plus 13-digit addition and 8-digit by 7-digit multiplication\\nvia random number generation. For mathematical word problems, we randomly selected 6\\nrepresentative questions (see Appendix E) from GSM-Ranges (Shrestha et al., 2025) with\\nlevel 6 perturbation to build a subset for evaluation.\\nModels. We evaluate multiple reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o3-min,\\nKimi k1.5 (long-CoT) (Team et al., 2025), Doubao (Deep Thinking) 3, and OpenAI-o1. To\\nacquire reasoning tokens, the models were accessed through their respective APIs using\\ndefault temperature settings and web-based conversations.\\nBenchmark. We conduct experimental evaluation following Algorithm 1, and use the\\nquestioning method illustrated in Figure 1 as our baseline. This baseline simply appends\\nthe question to the manipulated reasoning tokens by using a basic filter (i.e., \"Below is your\\nprevious thought.\"). We compare the baseline with three methods (Method 1-3) designed\\nto resist CPT. For mathematical calculation tasks, we adopt manipulated reasoning tokens\\nwith different levels of tampering, defined by DT ∈[1, 6]. We focus on the DT = 1 case\\nfor mathematical word problems, due to the complex numerical and logical structures of\\nthe tokens. To better demonstrate the impact of the CPT issue, we use DeepSeek-R1 for\\nM in Algorithm 1, as its generated long CoT exhibits a more rigorous and comprehensive\\nreasoning process.\\nEvaluation Protocol. For each model and problem combination, we first verify that the\\nmodel can correctly solve the problem independently. Then, following Algorithm 1, we\\npresent the model with the same problem appended with tampered reasoning tokens and\\nmeasure the compromising rate as defined in Equation 1. For structural modification\\nexperiments, we implement three variants (Delete-R, Delete-V, and Insertion) as described\\nin Section 3.5 and evaluate their impact on CPT resistance.\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\nIn Figure 4, we present the RCPT evaluation results for the reasoning LLMs performing both\\naddition and multiplication at various DT values. As far as we know, Doubao model cannot\\nimplement the output prefix method under deep-thinking, so its evaluation data for Method\\n3 are omitted and thus displayed as a zero value in Figure 5. Overall, Method 3 substantially\\noutperforms Method 1 and Method 2 in improving models’ resistance to CPT. Under the\\nbaseline condition, all models are noticeably affected by CPT, with DeepSeek-R1 being the\\nmost susceptible. For DeepSeek-R1, cases under Method 3 arise in which DT is lower than\\nDCPT, causing RCPT to exceed the baseline. This indicates that under the output prefix\\napproach, DeepSeek-R1’s mathematical computation capabilities are not robust enough.\\nFurthermore, it can be clearly observed that resistance to CPT generally strengthens as DT\\nincreases.\\n3https://www.doubao.com/chat\\n6\\nPreprint.

In Figure 8, we illustrate the reasoning performance of reasoning\\nLLMs for additive calculation under CPT setting and structural modifications on reasoning\\ntokens. Compared with the baseline method, all three approaches of modifying structure\\nimprove the model’s resistance to CPT. Among these approaches, Delete-R achieves optimal\\nperformance. Therefore, structural modifications are unlikely to significantly enhance the\\nimpact of CPT. This finding also suggests that for the CPT problem, local ending token\\nmanipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural alterations, which\\npartially conflicts with previous work (Li et al., 2025a) to some extent.\\n7\\nPreprint.

This section will further analyze these results, focusing on the additional\\nfindings and new contributions derived from them. We first investigate the impact of\\nvarying degrees of manipulation on CPT (Section 5.1), and then analyze the nature of CPT’s\\neffect on model reasoning (Section 5.2). Finally, we reveal a security vulnerability that\\nmanipulated tokens can lead DeepSeek-R1 to stop reasoning and fail to deliver a final\\nanswer (Section 5.3).\\n5.1\\nImpact of Different Degrees of Tampering on CPT\\nIn our experiments, along with the increasing of the number of tampered digits in ending\\nreasoning tokens, the reasoning LLMs become more likely to identify and self-correct errors\\nin the calculation results. This may be related to the existing research conclusion that LLMs\\nusually fail to confidently predict the last digit of calculation tasks (Gambardella et al., 2024).\\nIn fact, the degree of numerical discrepancy caused by tampering may be the key factor.\\nAs shown below, when the modified result deviates significantly from the correct result,\\nthe models exhibit higher confidence in identifying the error in the reasoning tokens and\\nproviding the correct result.\\nSignificant tampering enhances the model’s resistance to CPT\\nWhen I add them all together, I get $1,151,679,562, but the earlier provided result was $1,151,676,562.\\nThat’s a difference of $3,000, so I’m confident there was a small error in that chain-of-thought. The\\ncorrect total cost is $1,151,679,562.\\n5.2\\nFundamental Impact of CPT on the Reasoning Process\\nBy carefully analyzing the \"compromising thinking\" process in reasoning LLMs, we find\\nthat compared with the initial reasoning tokens rtm towards solving q0, the tokens under\\nCPT are markedly fewer, and the reasoning time is noticeably shorter (even reduced by\\nmore than 60%). The reason for this is that the models have great confidence that the\\ncalculation result provided is correct, and thus perform simple verification before ending\\nthe reasoning task. For o3-mini, the reasoning and answer tokens under CPT will show\\nobvious slackness, impatience and perfunctory behavior, as shown in Figure 6. The counts\\nof tokens are calculated by Tokenizer (\"GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini\") 4. The poor performance is\\nin sharp contrast to the initial tokens, which indicate the effort to think and pursue careful\\nexamination.\\nMoreover, when dealing with mathematical word problems, o3-mini significantly outper-\\nforms DeepSeek-R1 in resisting CPT. The essence is that the reasoning time under CPT of\\nDeepSeek-R1 is less than initial reasoning time, while that of o3-mini is just the opposite\\n(see Figure 7).

Therefore, TCPT should be\\nmore than Tinit. In fact, the three methods proposed in Section 3.4 all aim to make the\\nreasoning of LLMs more consistent with this principle.\\n5.3\\nThinking Stopped\\nWhen examining the impact of tampered reasoning tokens on the mathematical word\\nproblem solving of DeepSeek-R1, we accidentally observe an unsafe phenomenon: for\\ncertain questions, DeepSeek-R1 may stop thinking and fail to provide a final answer, as\\nshown in Appendix D. In this kind of reasoning tokens with thinking interruption, we can\\nstill clearly see that DeepSeek-R1 gives a relatively complete thinking process of problem\\nsolving, indicating the influence of CPT. When calling DeepSeek-R1 via its API, this thinking\\nstopped problem manifests as the value of choices[0].message.content in code being\\nempty. In our experiments, the probability of this phenomenon occurring for the chosen\\nproblems is extremely high. Further analysis reveals that the core reason for the problem is\\nthe presence of previously generated reasoning tokens for the same question in the prompt.\\nIn fact, the method to trigger this security vulnerability can be simplified as follows:\\n(rt, s) ←LMR1(q0), (rt1, s1) ←LMR1(rt),\\n(4)\\nwhere s1 has a very high probability of being empty. In other words, resubmitting to\\nDeepSeek-R1 the reasoning tokens it previously generated for q0 can cause its reasoning to\\nstop. This issue could lead to unexpected problems in downstream applications based on\\nLLMs, such as various Natural Language Processing systems exploiting LLM-based agents\\n(Zhang et al., 2024a). This discovery is of great significance for enhancing the security of\\nDeepSeek-R1 in the future.\\nThe overall structure of reasoning tokens generated by DeepSeek-R1 for mathematical word\\nproblems and standalone arithmetic tasks is similar, but this thinking stopped is difficult to\\noccur in our experiments targeting the latter. Our experimental results show that the core\\ntrigger factor has nothing to do with the count of tokens, and is more likely to be closely\\nrelated to the semantic logic within the reasoning tokens for mathematical word problem.\\nFurther investigations are needed to clarify the specific underlying logic responsible for this\\nvulnerability.\\n9\\nPreprint. Under review.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we explore the vulnerability of reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input\\nreasoning chains. Our findings indicate that long CoT with manipulated ending tokens can\\nmisguide reasoning LLMs to ignore the correct reasoning steps and give wrong final result.\\nFocused on mathematical problem-solving, we introduce the concept of CPT and demon-\\nstrate that existing reasoning LLMs struggle to resist CPT. In addition, our study reveals\\nthat local ending token modifications have a greater influence on model reasoning than\\nstructural changes. Finally, we discover a security vulnerability that tampered reasoning\\ntokens can cause DeepSeek-R1 to stop thinking and fail to deliver a final answer.\\nEthics Statement\\nSome of the research methods we designed may mislead LLMs into outputting incorrect\\nresults, requiring readers to have the ability to distinguish. Additionally, unsafe prompt-\\ning methods mentioned in the paper that could cause abnormal behavior of LLMs, such\\nas thinking stopped, should only be used for scientific research and authorized security\\nevaluation.\\nReferences\\nGuizhen Chen, Weiwen Xu, Hao Zhang, Hou Pong Chan, Chaoqun Liu, Lidong Bing,\\nDeli Zhao, Anh Tuan Luu, and Yu Rong.

Under review.\\nInstance 6: Multiplication by DeepSeek-R1 (Method 3: DT = 6)\\nTo calculate 38,697,082 × 4,133,991, let’s use scientific notation to simplify the process:\\n1. Approximate the numbers: - 38,697,082 ≈3.8697 × 107 - 4,133,991 ≈4.134 × 106\\n2. Multiply the coefficients:\\n3.8697 × 4.134 ≈16.0\\n(exact value: 3.8697 × 4.134 ≈16.0)\\n3. Add the exponents:\\n107 × 106 = 1013\\n4. Combine results:\\n16.0 × 1013 = 1.6 × 1014\\n(or 160,000,000,000,000)\\nHowever, this is an approximation. For the exact value, use direct multiplication:\\n38,697,082 × 4,133,991 = 160,000,000,000,000\\n(adjusted for precision)\\nFinal Answer: 160,000,000,000,000\\n(Note: The exact value requires precise arithmetic, but this is the closest simplified result using\\nscientific notation.)\\nInstance 7: Word problem by Kimi k1.5 (Method 1: DT = 1)\\nI need to find out how many eggs Janet has left after using some for breakfast and baking, and\\nthen calculate how much money she makes by selling the remaining eggs.\\nFirst, I subtract the eggs used for breakfast and muffins from the total eggs laid: - Total eggs laid:\\n8,488,302 - Eggs eaten for breakfast: 1,146,800 - Eggs used for muffins: 1,309,630\\nSo, the remaining eggs are:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 −1, 309, 630\\nLet me do the subtraction step by step: 1. Subtract the breakfast eggs:\\n8, 488, 302 −1, 146, 800 = 7, 341, 502\\n2. Subtract the muffin eggs:\\n7, 341, 502 −1, 309, 630 = 6, 031, 872\\nSo, Janet has 6,031,872 eggs left to sell.\\nNext, I calculate how much money she makes by selling these eggs at $7 each:\\n6, 031, 872 × 7\\nBreaking it down: - 6, 000, 000 × 7 = 42, 000, 000 - 31, 872 × 7 = 223, 104\\nAdding these together:\\n42, 000, 000 + 223, 104 = 42, 225, 104\\nSo, Janet makes 42225104 dollars every day at the farmers’ market.\\n17\\nPreprint. Under review.\\nInstance 8: Word problem by o3-mini (Method 1: DT = 1)\\nThe calculation you’ve outlined looks correct, but I agree that the numbers presented in the problem\\nseem to be extraordinarily large and likely unrealistic. Nonetheless, based on the information\\ngiven, we can proceed with the steps as follows:\\nStep-by-step breakdown:\\n1. Total classes in a week:\\n- Weekdays (Monday to Friday): 5,687,781 classes per day × 5 days = 28,438,905 classes.\\n- Saturday: 9,536,275 classes.\\nTotal weekly classes:\\n28,438,905 (weekdays) + 9,536,275 (Saturday) = 37,975,180 classes.\\n2. Total number of students:\\nEach class has 20 students, so:\\n37,975,180 classes × 20 students = 759,503,600 students.\\n3. Total revenue:\\nJudy charges $25 per student, so:\\n759,503,600 students × $25/student = $18,987,591,000.\\nFinal Answer:\\nJudy makes $18,987,591,000 in one week.\\nThis result seems incredibly high, which suggests that either the numbers provided are meant to be\\nfictional or there’s a mistake in how the numbers were presented. If there was a typo (for instance,\\nthe number of classes per day might have been intended to be much smaller), the total revenue\\nwould be much more realistic.\\nB\\nInstances of Revised Results\\nInstance 1: Addition by o3-mini (Baseline:DT = 1)\\nThe sum is 711,025,910,075,981.\\nHere’s a quick breakdown:\\nUnits: 043 + 938 = 981\\nThousands: 349 + 726 = 1,075 →write 075 and carry 1 to the millions\\nMillions: 514 + 395 = 909; plus the carry gives 910\\nBillions: 537 + 488 = 1,025 →write 025 and carry 1 to the trillions\\nTrillions: 705 + 5 = 710; plus the carry gives 711\\nPutting it all together:\\n711 (trillions), 025 (billions), 910 (millions), 075 (thousands), 981 (u\\nw711,025,910,075,981.\\n18\\nPreprint.

Below is your previous thought.\\nAlright, so I need to add these two big numbers: 705,537,514,349,043 and 5,488,395,726,938. Hmm,\\nlet me see. Okay, first, adding large numbers can be a bit intimidating because there are so many\\ndigits, but if I take it step by step, it should be manageable...\\nSo the resulting number is:\\n7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check if that makes sense. Let’s break it down with commas:\\nStarting from the right, every three digits:\\n... 5981 →but let’s group the digits:\\n711,025,710,075,981?\\nWait, let’s see:\\nDigits:7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nGrouping from the right:\\n15 digits: 7 1 1 0 2 5 7 1 0 0 7 5 9 8 1\\nStarting from the right, three by three:\\n981 (positions 13-15)\\n598 (positions 10-12): Wait, no. Let’s index them:\\n...\\nSo putting commas: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut wait, the commas in large numbers go every three digits starting from the right, so it should\\nbe: 711,025,710,075,981\\nBut let’s verify the addition another way. Let’s convert the numbers to something more manage-\\nable...\\nBut when you have 1,025 billion, that’s 1 trillion and 25 billion. Similarly, 1,075 thousand is 1\\nmillion and 75 thousand.\\nSo adjusting:\\n710 trillion + 1 trillion = 711 trillion\\n25 billion + 909 million + 1 million = 25 billion + 910 million\\n75 thousand + 981 units = 75 thousand 981\\nSo the result would be 711,025,710,075,981\\nWhich matches the earlier result. Therefore, the sum is 711,025,710,075,981.\\nLet me check with another method. Let’s subtract a small number to see.\\nAlternatively, use approximate values to check. 705 trillion + 5 trillion is 710 trillion. But the actual\\nnumbers are slightly more: 705,537... +5,488... So roughly 705.5 +5.5 =711 trillion. The exact answer\\nis 711,025,710,075,981, which is about 711.025 trillion, which makes sense.\\nTherefore, I’m confident the answer is correct.\\n21\\nPreprint.
